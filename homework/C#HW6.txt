1. What is an exception?

An exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program.
C# exception handling is built upon four keywords: try, catch, finally,
 and throw.
 
2. What happens in a try block if the program executes without errors?

When the code runs, it attempts to execute all the statements in the
 try block, and if none of the statements generates an exception,
they all run, one after the other, to completion.

3. How does the catch mechanism work for unhandled exceptions?

The int.Parse statement would throw an Overfl owException,
which will not be caught by the FormatException catch handler.
 If this occurs and the try block is part of a method, the method
 immediately exits and execution returns to the calling method.
 If the calling method uses a try block, the runtime attempts to
 locate and execute a matching catch handler for this try block. If the
 calling method does not use a try block or if there is no matching catch
 handler, the calling method immediately exits, and execution returns to
 its caller, where the process is repeated.

4. What happens in a program if an exception block fails to handle an
 particular error?
 
 If your catch block throws an exception and there are no other catch 
 blocks to handle it besides the one that caused it, it will continue 
 to get re thrown then 'Windows handles it'. If a exception occurs the
 CLR traverses up the call stack looking for a matching catch expression.
 
5. What is the parent class for all exceptions? How does this work?

The parent class of all the exception classes is the java. lang. 
Exception class,

6. How do you determine the type of an error?
7. What is the purpose of integer checking?
8. What is the range of values than a signed Int32 type can contain? 
State the lowest value and the
highest value.
9. What is the range of values than an unsigned Int32 type can contain?
 State the lowest value and the
highest value. What is the dierence between a signed integer and an
 unsigned integer? Can signed
integers and unsigned integers represent the same amount of numbers?
10. What does the nally block do?

Java finally block is a block that is used to execute important code such
 as closing connection, stream etc. Java finally block is always executed
 whether exception is handled or not. Java finally block follows try or
 catch block.
 
11. (Thought question) When would you not use a nally block in a
 try/catch construction?
