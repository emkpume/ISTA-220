1. What are the possible values of a Boolean expression ?

A Boolean expression always evaluates to true or false.
Visual C# provides a data type called bool. 
A bool variable can hold one of two values: true or false
 
2. List eight Boolean operators.

A Boolean operator is an operator that performs a calculation whose result is
 either true or false. C# has several very useful Boolean operators, the
 simplest of which is the NOT operator, represented by the exclamation point
 (!). The ! operator negates a Boolean value, yielding the opposite of that
 value.
 operator meaning
 ==       equal to
 !=       non equal to
 <        less than
 <=       less than or equal to
 >        greater than
 >=       greater than or equal to
 &&        CONDITIONAL AND 
 ||       CONDITIONAL OR
 NOTE: && AND || are known as conditional logical operators.

3. What is the general concept of short circuiting ? This question has a 
short and simple answer and do not need to have a detailed response.

The && and || operators both exhibit a feature called short-circuiting. 
This is when the whole expression can be evaluated to true or false
 without evaluating all sub expressions.
 
4. what are the difference in how short circuiting works for && and || ?

if the left operand of the && operator evaluates to false, the result of
 the entire expression must be false regardless of the value of the right 
 operand. Similarly, if the value of the left operand of the || operator 
 evaluates to true, the result of the entire expression must be true, 
 irrespective of the value of the right operand.
 
5. Look at the list of operators. What operator has the highest precedence ? 
which has the lowest ?

When a complex expression has multiple operators, operator precedence determines
the sequence of operations. The order of execution can significantly affect
 the resulting value. 
 ~ (Bitwise NOT)IS HIGHEST
 = (assignmnet) is LOWEST
 
6. In an if or else construction using multiple lines of code, what effect does
 the use of curly braces have ?
 
 Use of Curly Braces {}:  Curly braces is used to group a set of statement
 and deceleration. We use them along with loops and conditional statements
 in order to avoid confusion and to define a clear scope. And it follows a
 rule every opening brace must have a closing brace in order to define a 
 clear boundary.
 
 
7. In a switch statement, what happens if you omt break ?

Without break, the program continues to the next case, executing the statements 
until a break or the end of the statement is reached.

8. (not in book) What is a recursive method ? Uisng alanguage you know (such
 as english) write a recursive method that adds up the integers in a list of integers.
 The input to the methods is a list of integers and the output is a scaler value
 representing a sum.
 
 A method that calls itself is known as a recursive method. And, this technique
is known as recursion. A physical world example would be to place two 
parallel mirrors facing each other. Any object in between them would be
 reflected recursively.
 
9. (not in book) Read a short summary of De Morgan's Laws.
	(a) Explain how this statement, :It's not snowing or raining," is the 
	same as this statement, "Its not snowing and it's not raining."
	(b) Explain how this statement,I'm not running and walking." is the same
	as this statement, "I'm not running or I'm not walking." 
	
	De Morgan's Laws describe how mathematical statements and concepts 
	are related through their opposites. In set theory, De Morgan's Laws 
	relate the intersection and union of sets through complements. 
	In propositional logic, De Morgan's Laws relate conjunctions and 
	disjunctions of propositions through negation.
