---1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work?

compound assignment operators combine any arithmetic operator with
 the assignment operator. eg. answer+=42
 to add 42 to answer, you can write it using the operator '+='
answer += 42;
The += operator also works on strings; it appends one string to
 the end of another.
 
--2. List all the compound assignment operators.

Donâ€™t write this                   Write this
variable = variable * number;     variable *= number;
variable = variable / number;     variable /= number;
variable = variable % number;     variable %= number;
variable = variable + number;     variable += number;
variable = variable - number;     variable -= number;

--3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways
 to decrement a numeric variable by 50.
 
 Use the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators instead of a compound 
 assignment operator when incrementing or decrementing a variable. 
 For example, replace
count += 5;
with
count++;

--4. How long does a while loop run?

until the limit set by the programmer.

--5. What is an iteratiion variable? (Not in book)

Each time we execute the body of the loop, we call it an iteration.
We call the variable that changes each time the loop executes and controls
 when the loop finishes the iteration variable. If there is no iteration
 variable, the loop will repeat forever, resulting in an infinite loop.
 
--6. What happens if you don't change the loop variable in the body of
 the while loop block?
 
 it runs forever
 
--7. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any
of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them?

The For-EndFor Statement Structure Similar to a While loop,
 a For loop consists of three parts: 
the keyword For that starts the loop,
 the condition being tested, and
 the EndFor keyword that terminates the loop.
 no.
 it wont run.
 
--8. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?

A do.. while loop is almost the same as a while loop except that the loop
 body is guaranteed to execute at least once. A while loop says "Loop while
 the condition is true, and execute this block of code", a do.. while loop 
 says "Execute this block of code, and then continue to loop while the 
 condition is true".
 
--9. What does the break statement do?

When a break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately
terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following 
the loop. It can be used to terminate a case in the switch statement.

--10. What does the continue statement do?

The continue statement is used inside loops. When a continue statement is
 encountered inside a loop, control jumps to the beginning of the loop for
 next iteration, skipping the execution of statements inside the body of 
 loop for the current iteration.
 
--11. (Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want
 to have an innite loop? An
\i nnite loop" is a loop without an update variable that in eect
 runs forever. As you will see, these kinds of loops are written
 intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks.
